# RRPs in Isolation

This study attempts to further our understanding of how media sentiment influences voting intentions for right-wing populist parties. Previous research has discussed persuasion and backfire effects in that regard. Drawing on these findings, we demonstrate theoretically, that party evaluation may link media with voting intentions either as a mediator or as a moderator. Repeated cross-sectional German survey data from 2015 to 2017 and an extensive media sentiment analysis from more than 6000 articles enables us to profoundly test these assumptions empirically. Using structural equation modelling, our results indicate, that more negative press coverage is rather associated with higher voting intentions for the right-wing populist party ‘AfD’, yielding support for backfire effects. Additionally, the results show temporal differences. While party evaluation acts as a moderator for the association between media and voting intentions in 2015, the mediation is significant for the following two years. We briefly discuss possible avenues for future research to explain this change such as a possible change in the party´s ideology or its further establishment. Collectively, these results testify to the importance of party evaluation as key contextual sources of media sentiment on voting intentions.

## Visualizations of main results

<img src="forest_plots.png" width="600">

Figure 1: Forest plot visualizing standardized results of multivariate multi-group structural equation models. The plots are separated by variables and grouped by countries within each plot. Letters in parentheses indicate the origin of the data, C for the CSES data set, R for the REC data set. The order of the countries follows the position of the RRP and is furthermore highlighted by colors: light blue denotes countries in which the RRP is isolated, dark blue dots are used for countries in which the RRP was part of a cabinet or supported a minority government before. Purple indicates countries in which the RRP was governing during the fieldwork period.

Figure 2: These charts show the effect of dissatisfaction on sympathy for the RRP for different levels of anti-immigration attitudes (blue = arithmetic mean, red = mean -1SD, green = mean +1SD). Letters in parentheses refer to the data set (C for CSES, R for RECONNECT). For Sweden (C) the index of anti-imigration attitudes misses one variable, thus it has only nine levels, which are all displayed by different colors (red = lowest, grey = highest). The countries are grouped in rows by the status of the RRP in the respective country, as indicated at the left of the panels.
